\chapter{Vector calculus}
\label{chapter:appendix}

Use to include images/diagrams tables which are important but were to big to include in the main tex.

Note that in no case the document can exceed a total of 100 pages.

Some equations examples:

\section{Vector identities}
\label{section:vectorIdentities}

\begin{equation}
	\nabla \times \left( \nabla \phi \right) = 0
	\label{eq:cross_nnp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\nabla \cdot \left( \nabla \times {\bf u} \right) = 0
	\label{eq:dotCross_nnu}
\end{equation}
